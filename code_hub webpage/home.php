<h3 style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h3><br>
A programming language is an artificial language that can be used to control the behaviour of a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages, like human languages, are defined through the use of syntactic and semantic rules, to determine structure and meaning respectively.<br>
Programming languages are used to facilitate communication about the task of organizing and manipulating information, and to express algorithms precisely. Some authors restrict the term "programming language" to those languages that can express all possible algorithms; sometimes the term " computer language" is used for more limited artificial languages.<br>
Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and new ones are created every year.<br>
<h3 style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">coding use</h3>
<h3 style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">1. Coding can help you understand technology</h3><br>
Technology is everywhere in the modern world and continues to develop at an astonishing rate. Coding already plays a key part in this technological evolution and will become increasingly important in light of new robotics and automated technologies. Learning to code will give you the tools you need to go on and be part of shaping the future. This could include roles in RPA, building automated systems for global banks or healthcare organisations, or even helping to improve the tech in self-driving cars - this is just scratching the surface!<br>
<h3 style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">2. It can enhance problem-solving skills</h3><br>
Coding can help you improve your logical thinking skills by allowing you to see problems from a new perspective. Complex coding projects are made up of smaller tasks and by breaking down the problem and adopting a methodological way of thinking, you can tackle any challenge. This can be applied to any scenario in both your personal and professional life.<br>
